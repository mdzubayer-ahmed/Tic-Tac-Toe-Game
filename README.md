## Usage

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `ticTacToe.py` file.
3. Run the script with Python by executing:
    python tic_tac_toe.py

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input player names and moves.

## How to Play

- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
- Players will be prompted to enter their moves in the format `rowcol` (e.g., `00` for the top-left corner).
- Player 1 plays as `0`, and Player 2 plays as `X`.
- The game continues until one player wins by having three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or if all spaces are filled, resulting in a tie.
